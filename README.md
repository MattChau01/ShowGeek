# ajax-project

An application that allows you to search for a television with specific key words and log personal show reviews. This app utilizes a public API that stores information about television shows across different streaming platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, and many more! Feel free to test out this application with the live link provided: https://mattchau01.github.io/ajax-project/

After searching for a television show, a result should populate with a breif summary and a button to let you add to your list. When clicked on `add to list`, you will be prompted with a modal that requests you to select a star rating, and provide a brief review. When completed, you will be redirected to your list of shows. As a result, a box is generated with your input. You will notice that an image, star icons and review is generated altogether.
